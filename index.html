<!-- Objectives: 
➝ To understand arrays in java script. 
➝ To perform CRUD operations on array.
➝ To use java script array functions.

Multi dimensional arrays are one of the most important concept used in the real world. Multidimensional arrays are not directly provided in JavaScript. If we want to use anything which acts as a multidimensional array then we need to create a multidimensional array by using another one-dimensional array. So multidimensional arrays in JavaScript is known as arrays inside another array. 

In this task we will be working on 2-dimensional product data, you have to create a 2-dimensional array of data and perform all the operations related to product page. 

Complete the following sub-tasks .

1. CREATE 
Create a 2 dimensional array 
Use the following image for reference to take user input and push data into array.
Use inbuilt array methods 
Make sure that all input boxes do not take unwanted values

NOTE: Use java script, do not use object array, use for each loop.

2.Display
Now once the array is created display data in tabular format having following columns
Selection (Add check boxes, this will be later used for deletion)
Company name (From array)
Model (From array)
Memory (From array)
Price (From array)
Quantity (This will be updated later, use initial value 50 for each product)
Rating (This will be updated later, use "Not rated yet" initially)

 Note: You will be adding methods on events for the newly column used in this task, design accordingly. 

 3.SEARCHING

 Add a drop down with following values, Select Field, Company, Model, Memory and Price 
Add a text box that takes user input 
Add a search button to search and display the product according to the the value selected from drop down and value entered in the input box
For example: if "Company" is selected in drop down and "Samsung" is entered in text box (case in sensitive) then on clicking on search button a new table is displayed as per search.
If item is not found a blank table should be displayed with only table headings. 

NOTE: Search should be case insensitive.

4. sorting

Add two drop downs as shown in figure.
First drop down will have three values, Sort(initially selected), Ascending and Descending. 
Second drop down have five values, Sort by(initially selected), Company, Model, Memory and Price.
A user can select either or both drop down and array should be sorted and displayed accordingly.
If user changes any of the drop down the data should be sorted accordingly
For example: if in first drop down "Ascending" is selected and in second drop down "Company" is selected and user changes second drop down to "Model" the table should be displayed sorted in ascending order according to "Model".

5. DELETE
A user can select one or more products from the table.
Add a delete button.
On clicking delete the data should be removed from original array.
Then display updated data in place of original data. 

6.UPDATION
Inventory manager should be able to update the quantity of a products. 
Use a drop down in which every value is a combination of "Company" and "Model".
Use a text box to enter a non negative value.
On clicking "Update" button update the quantity in original array.
Display updated data

Note: Make sure to apply proper validation

7.BILL GENERATION
Select product(s) from the list and their quantity. 
Add them to a array then generate a billing invoice according to the attachment.
Use a drop down in which every value is a combination of "Company" and "Model".
On clicking add button make sure that the quantity entered is less than the quantity available.
If the quantity available is less than quantity entered then display a proper error.
If the quantity available is more than quantity entered update the available quantity in original array, also check if the item is already added the update its quantity accordingly.  
On clicking generate bill display a proper invoice.

8.PRODUCT RATING
Customer should be able to mark the rating for a product that should be visible in the rating column.
Use first drop down in which every value is a combination of "Company" and "Model".
Use second drop down in which a user can select values from 1 to 5.
On Clicking "Rate" button rating should be updated.

9.FILTER USING RANGE
Filter and display the products with in a given price range.
Use 2 text box to enter minimum and maximum values.
Display the data in a new table accordingly

10.MOBILE FRIENDLY DESIGN
Convert current design into mobile friendly design
Use media query
Take dimensions of iphone 12 pro for reference
Follow BEM methodology 


11.JAVASCRIPT TODO APP
Create a ToDo list based on template provided.
Conditions:
add/delete/update todo.
Mark complete todo.
List completed and pending todos in different group as in template.
Once use click edit todo, value should populate in top todo form and ADD button should change to UPDATE button.

a) CLASSES
Objectives: 
➝To understand concepts of classes and objects in JavaScript.
➝To understand how input is handled into output.
➝To understand how to implement modular approach. 
	
Design an HTML page to take the employee details as input from the user.
Write a class to declare all the the details of the employee as mentioned in the above HTML page. 
Create an object of the class and display it.

B) ARRYA OF OBJECTS
Objective: 
➝ To understand concepts array of objects in JavaScript.
➝ To perform CRUD operations on object array.
➝ To understand how to implement modular approach.

Use the following "data.js" file for object array.
Create and push the data in the original object array and display "id", "name","priority" and "Colour"(display colour, do not write colour code) in tabular format.
Now delete the object with id "205202714" and display it tabular format.
Change the name field of id "193352341" and display it tabular format.
Now display all ids in drop down format.

NOTE: Make buttons for every action (Push, Delete, Update)
Use in-built methods

C) PROMISES
Create a function that takes two parameters and returns a promise.
If the first value is divisible by second value, return the value else return "rejected".
Use a delay of 2 seconds.
Console the output.

➝ To understand concepts of 'this' in java script.
➝ To understand how to manipulate values using 'this'.
➝ To implement simple logic building.

Create a game "tic-tac-toe".
Create a table with 3 rows and 3 columns.
On clicking a call call a function by passing 'this' as a parameter.
Update the cell value using 'this'.
For first player use "0" and for second user use "X".
Game winning condition: if we have 3 consecutive 0s or Xs vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

NOTE: Make sure user is not able to update cell again, show alert message for displaying the winner.

E) Async, await and fetch()

Objective: 
➝ To understand concepts of async, await in JavaScript.
➝ To make use of fetch method.
➝ To make use of try-catch.

Create an async function fetchData.
In the method use await to fetch data from the following URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos. 
Return data in json format.
If successful, display result properly in tabular format.
Use try catch to display the error (Do not use catch method of promise in this example). 

F)Arrow function

Objective:

➝ To understand the concept of Date object.

Take 2 input boxes for start year and end year.
Display all the dates where day is "Friday" and date is "13".
Both the years are inclusive.
Use arrow function. 

NOTE: Make sure to apply proper validations.

G) modules

Objective: 
➝ To understand concepts of modules in JavaScript.

Create a separate JS file with a employee detail.
Import it to your main HTML/JS code. 
Display this employee details in the HTML page.

Consider a JS file with the content given below:

const id = "4";
const name = "Jesse";
const salary = 10000;
export {id, name, salary};

H) Regular expressions

In this task a string is given that contains multiple words white space delimited numbers. Each number has a single alphabet letter somewhere within it. 
	                      var data = "24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b"
You have to extract the letters and sort the numbers according to their corresponding letters.
Example : "24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b" will become 89 900 123 369 246 (ordered according to the alphabet letter).
Use regular expression for extraction. 

I) JavaScript DOM

Objectives:
➝ To understand the DOM manipulation using JavaScript. 


Create an HTML page with following Tags
    <h1 name="name">Heading 1</h1>
    <h1 class="bingo">Heading 1</h1>
    <h1 id="id" name="id">Heading 1</h1>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>

Create a function that will change all <H1> tags to <H2> except tag with class "bingo"
Also copy attribute of every tag

J) CODE OPTIMIZATION

Objective: 
➝ To understand and implement code optimisation.
