<!-- Objectives: 
➝ To understand arrays in java script. 
➝ To perform CRUD operations on array.
➝ To use java script array functions.

Multi dimensional arrays are one of the most important concept used in the real world. Multidimensional arrays are not directly provided in JavaScript. If we want to use anything which acts as a multidimensional array then we need to create a multidimensional array by using another one-dimensional array. So multidimensional arrays in JavaScript is known as arrays inside another array. 

In this task we will be working on 2-dimensional product data, you have to create a 2-dimensional array of data and perform all the operations related to product page. 

Complete the following sub-tasks .

1. CREATE 
Create a 2 dimensional array 
Use the following image for reference to take user input and push data into array.
Use inbuilt array methods 
Make sure that all input boxes do not take unwanted values

NOTE: Use java script, do not use object array, use for each loop.

2.Display
Now once the array is created display data in tabular format having following columns
Selection (Add check boxes, this will be later used for deletion)
Company name (From array)
Model (From array)
Memory (From array)
Price (From array)
Quantity (This will be updated later, use initial value 50 for each product)
Rating (This will be updated later, use "Not rated yet" initially)

 Note: You will be adding methods on events for the newly column used in this task, design accordingly. 

 3.SEARCHING

 Add a drop down with following values, Select Field, Company, Model, Memory and Price 
Add a text box that takes user input 
Add a search button to search and display the product according to the the value selected from drop down and value entered in the input box
For example: if "Company" is selected in drop down and "Samsung" is entered in text box (case in sensitive) then on clicking on search button a new table is displayed as per search.
If item is not found a blank table should be displayed with only table headings. 

NOTE: Search should be case insensitive.

4. sorting

Add two drop downs as shown in figure.
First drop down will have three values, Sort(initially selected), Ascending and Descending. 
Second drop down have five values, Sort by(initially selected), Company, Model, Memory and Price.
A user can select either or both drop down and array should be sorted and displayed accordingly.
If user changes any of the drop down the data should be sorted accordingly
For example: if in first drop down "Ascending" is selected and in second drop down "Company" is selected and user changes second drop down to "Model" the table should be displayed sorted in ascending order according to "Model".

5. DELETE
A user can select one or more products from the table.
Add a delete button.
On clicking delete the data should be removed from original array.
Then display updated data in place of original data. 

6.UPDATION
